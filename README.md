# lazyfoo-sdl-tutorial
Saving sample codes from Lazy Foo's SDL Tutorial in this repo. Currently doing it in Golang

This code follows http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/index.php, I do not own the content that is being taught in the tutorials

Self notes: Dualshock v2 rumble is working using deepin 15.6 and SDL 2.0.8.
Mp3 files currently can't be read using SDL_mixer 2.0.2. Don't know if it's a bug of the current version, or if I'm missing a package. Mp3 worked fine using Ubuntu 16.04 and SDL_mixe 2.0.0.
